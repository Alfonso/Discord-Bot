# Discord-Bot

## What is this?
This is a discord bot that plays sound clips and sends messages in response to certain commands.
It is created for my discord server that have for me and my friends.

## Why does this exist?
It started out as a meme that we would play different soundclips in different channels while playing games.
Because of this, I wanted to make a bot that would remain in the server and play an audio file whenever on command.

## What Now?
I am planning on adding more features and commands whenever I see fit (or am asked to by my friends).
The docoumentation for discord.io was not as thorough as I hoped and ran into some issues when implementing
some of the different comamnds.
